"""Validation layer: checks the AI's plan BEFORE anything touches a device.

The AI can make mistakes, so we never trust it blindly. Checks:
  1. the device exists in the knowledge base
  2. we have a driver for its vendor
  3. the device is reachable (not "down")
  4. there are commands and a rollback
  5. no dangerous commands (rules.py)
  6. "check" steps only contain read-only commands (ping, show...), and
     "config" steps don't contain them (they only work outside config mode)
  7. physical interfaces in the commands (Ethernet0/0, Gi0/1...) really exist
     on the device (we know them from "Find links & IPs")
  8. a risky change (shutdown, ACL...) on a device that is a single point of failure
     gets an extra warning saying which parts of the network would be cut off

Result: {"ok": bool, "errors": [...], "warnings": [...]}
Errors block the change. Warnings are shown to the user before they approve.

Ideas for later: test the config in a lab (GNS3/EVE-NG) or with Batfish,
check for IP conflicts using the knowledge base, ask a second LLM to review.
